The goal of the MoveFuns Web3 StarTrek is to build a learning community to explore the Web3 universe together.
The name StarTrek stands for 'Star Trek' and pays homage to [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek).


## Learning Direction

1. Web3 and Move smart contract direction

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn front-end DApp framework

2. Rust and the direction of blockchain development

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn Rust and chain implementation

3. Rust and Move language development direction

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn the implementation of the Move language and the virtual machine

## Learning Materials

* [MoveBook](https://move-language.github.io/move/)
* [Starcoin Cookbook](https://cookbook.starcoin.org)
* [0L Dev Resource](https://0l.network/technology/developer-resources/)
* [Aptos Dev](https://aptos.dev/)
* [Sui Docs](https://docs.sui.io/build)

## Register a wallet

*Wallet* is the key to the Web3 world. *Wallet* can manage your account information and assets in the chain well.

* Starcoin
  Before participating in the *StarTrek*, you need to have a Starcoin account.
  You can register an account with your *StarMask wallet* or use the *starcoin* command to generate an account and export a private key. **(Take care of your private key!)**
  Generally, the former is the most recommended and friendly way to register the Starcoin account.
  Please refer to [StarMask Introduction](https://starcoinorg.github.io/starcoin-cookbook/docs/getting-started/accounts/use-starmask/) for specific steps.
* 0L (TODO)
* Aptos (TODO)
* Sui (TODO)

When you register your wallet, you can start the Web3 journey. Next, we will introduce how to participate.

## How to participate

1. Join [MoveFunsDAO Telegram](https://t.me/movefunsdao)
2. Fork this repository, copy the [members/githubid.md](./members/githubid.md) file as `members/$your_github_id.md`, edit the content according to your own information, and submit a Pull Request to this repository, the registration is successful.
3. During the learning process, the learning log of the file and the learning results can be continuously updated. If you have problems in the learning process, you can discuss in the group. If you need some practice assignments, but you can't find a suitable one, you can ask your instructor.
4. If you feel that your learning results can be graduated, you can comment @ Mentor, and after the Mentor has reviewed it, it will be merged into the repository, marking the end of the Learn stage. MoveFuns DAO gives Token rewards.
5. Considering that there are differences in the spare time of different people, there is no time limit for the overall learning cycle. If you want to end it halfway, you can close the Pull Request directly. Of course, a Pull Request that has been inactive for a long time (more than a month) will also be considered a dropout.
6. Any suggestions or questions can be submitted to [Discussions](https://github.com/movefuns/web3startrek/discussions) for discussion.

## Graduation Criteria

### Basic requirements

* Technology needs to involve Move + (Web|Rust|Other Language).

### L1 graduation

* Proof of Move language mastery through learning logs and practice projects
* 200$ USDT or STC equivalent will be awarded.

### L2 Graduation

* Contribute new standalone Move modules to the community
* Publish Move-related tutorials
* Contributed PR to the Move eco-projects ([move-language](https://github.com/move-language), [movefuns](https://github.com/movefuns)), mentor will evaluate the complexity of PR
* Two of the above three items must be satisfied
* 300$ USDT or STC equivalent

### Additional bonus for eco-projects

* Significant PR contribution to projects under [starcoinorg](https://github.com/starcoinorg): additional $500 USDT or STC equivalent
* Significant PR contribution to projects under [OLSF](https://github.com/OLSF): (TODO)
* Significant PR contribution to projects under [aptos-labs](https://github.com/aptos-labs): (TODO)
* Significant PR contribution to projects under [MystenLabs](https://github.com/MystenLabs): (TODO)
* Awards from other projects are welcome

When you believe you have met the graduation criteria. You can `@Mentor` to review the graduation status, at least **two** mentors are required to approve the PR, when the PRs are combined it means you successfully graduated and you will receive the *graduation reward*.
L2 graduates need to `@ a mentor` who has helped you the most during your studies, and this mentor will also receive a *mentoring bonus*.


## Economic Model

In the traditional learning method, students pay to schools or training institutions, and there is no reason to **Earn** through learning in turn.
But at the same time, we can also find that companies need to spend a high cost to select suitable talents and train new employees.
The inventors of new technologies have to spend a lot of money if they want to promote new technologies in the market.
If we combine several parties, the **Learning** process is also the process of selecting talents, training employees, or promoting technology, and we can realize **LearnToEarn**, which is especially suitable for open source projects.


## Route Map

1. Through the activities of the first phase, a relatively complete operation method was explored.
2. Recruit full-time or part-time navigators (instructors) to create a curriculum system.
3. Set up StarTrek DAO, try to organize and run StarTrek through the on-chain DAO model, and issue soul-bound NFT graduation certificates to graduate members.
4. Explore patterns for incubating projects in StarTrek.
