The goal of the Starcoin Web3 StarTrek is to build a learning community to explore the Web3 universe together.
The name StarTrek stands for 'Star Trek' and pays homage to [Star Trek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek).

The source of this idea is that we found that many developers want to learn blockchain and Web3, but this field has a certain learning threshold, which is often difficult to adhere to, and at the same time, there is a large shortage of talents in this field.

So in order to motivate new developers to participate in blockchain and Web3, we try to do a LearnToEarn experiment, where developers can earn while learning.
After the event was launched, everyone's enthusiasm for participating exceeded expectations, and soon enough developers were recruited for the first phase.
Therefore, we plan to make it a long-term project, and then we have the StarTrek.

## Economic Model

In the traditional learning method, students pay to schools or training institutions, and there is no reason to **Earn** through learning in turn.
But at the same time, we can also find that companies need to spend a high cost to select suitable talents and train new employees.
The inventors of new technologies have to spend a lot of money if they want to promote new technologies in the market.
If we combine several parties, the **Learning** process is also the process of selecting talents, training employees, or promoting technology, and we can realize **LearnToEarn**, which is especially suitable for open source projects.

## Mode of Operation

It is still in the pioneering and initial stage, and many operating rules are still being explored, which need to be collided with the participants of the first phase. There are currently several challenges:

1. The community's documentation and learning materials are incomplete, and there is a lack of tutors. It is difficult to guide newbies. In the early stage, developers can only rely on self-study and build learning materials together.

2. Are entry rules required to participate in the event? What are the conditions? An admission rule for a simple interview is currently set.

3. What is Earn based on? The initial idea is to calculate a value based on the average learning time of developers in the first phase, which can motivate developers who learn fast.

4. How is the final learning outcome measured? There are currently several ideas:

    * Through learning, you can carry out some formal development tasks, and participate in the development of Starcoin and Starcoin ecological projects full-time or part-time.

    * I have independently developed a DApp (including smart contracts and front-end), or an independent ecological tool application.

## Route Map

1. Through the activities of the first phase, a relatively complete operation method was explored.
2. Recruit full-time or part-time navigators (instructors) to create a curriculum system.
3. Set up StarTrek DAO, try to organize and run StarTrek through the on-chain DAO model, and issue soul-bound NFT graduation certificates to graduate members.
4. Explore patterns for incubating projects in StarTrek.

## Learning Direction

1. Web3 and Move smart contract direction

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn front-end DApp framework

2. Rust and the direction of blockchain development

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn Rust and chain implementation

3. Rust and Move language development direction

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn the Move smart contract
    * Learn the implementation of the Move language and the virtual machine

4. Starcoin technical documentation writing

    * Learn the concept of chains and use of node commands
    * Learn from the [Starcoin Cookbook](https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin-cookbook)
    * Learn how to polish the content of the article so that beginners can learn Starcoin better

## How to get involved

1. Join [Starcoin&Move Contributor Telegram Group](https://t.me/starcoin_contributor)
2. Join [Starcoin Discord](https://discord.gg/starcoin)
3. Fork this repository, copy the [members/githubid.md](./members/githubid.md) file as `members/$your_github_id.md`, edit the content according to your own information, and submit a Pull Request to this repository, the registration is successful.
4. Submit the above PR in the [dev-role-apply](https://discord.com/channels/822159062475997194/980384341181993000) channel of Starcoin Discrod, apply for the `Dev-Leaner` role, and get a voice in Dev-related channels.
5. Find and connect with a `mentor` based on your learning goals in the mentors directory.
6. During the learning process, the learning log of the file and the learning results can be continuously updated. If you have problems in the learning process, you can discuss in the group. If you need some practice assignments, but you can't find a suitable one, you can ask your instructor.
7. If you feel that your learning results can be graduated, you can comment @ Mentor, and after the Mentor has reviewed it, it will be merged into the repository, marking the end of the Learn stage (you can @jolestar before the Mentor system is built). StarTrek DAO gives $STC Token rewards (issued by mentors before StarTrek DAO is established). $STC will go directly to the address filled in the above file.
8. Considering that there are differences in the spare time of different people, there is no time limit for the overall learning cycle. If you want to end it halfway, you can close the Pull Request directly. Of course, a Pull Request that has been inactive for a long time (more than a month) will also be considered a dropout.
9. Any suggestions or questions can be submitted to [Discussions · starcoinorg/startrek (github.com)](https://github.com/starcoinorg/startrek/discussions) for discussion.
