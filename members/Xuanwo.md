I'm trying to **learn**, **work** and **think** in an open-source way.

### Learn publicly in an open-source way

- discuss with all my friends publicly at [discussions](https://github.com/Xuanwo/Xuanwo/discussions).
- public all my notes at [Xuanwo's Note](https://note.xuanwo.io)

### Work publicly and report to the community

- I get paid for my work in open source projects. (For now, I'm backed by [@datafuselabs](https://github.com/datafuselabs))
- I publicly track all my works at [Xuanwo's Work](https://work.xuanwo.io)

Projects that I'm working on

- [databend](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend): A modern Elasticity and Performance cloud data warehouse, activate your object storage for real-time analytics.
- [opendal](https://github.com/datafuselabs/opendal): Open Data Access Layer that connect the whole world together.
- [reqsign](https://github.com/Xuanwo/reqsign): Signing HTTP requests without heavy SDKs.

- [serde-bridge](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serde-bridge): A bridge between different serde implemantations.
- [serde-env](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serde-env): Deserialize env into structs via serde.
- [serfig](https://github.com/Xuanwo/serfig): Layered configuration system built upon serde.

- [hdrs](https://github.com/Xuanwo/hdrs): HDFS Native Client in Rust based on [hdfs-sys](https://github.com/Xuanwo/hdfs-sys).

### Think publicly and export to blog posts

- I will write at [Xuanwo's Blog](https://xuanwo.io) if there are any thought I think is meaningful to report.

## Learning Notes

All my learning notes will be published at [Xuanwo's Note](https://note.xuanwo.io), search `Starcoin` and `Rust` to know more.

## Learning Outcomes

I will publish my PR links, documents and blog links here, TBD.
